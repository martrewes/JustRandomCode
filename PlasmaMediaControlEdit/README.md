# PlasmaMediaControlEdit

## Basic Reimplementation of the Media Control Plasma Widget

>*Keeping for my own use in case of Plasma reinstall*

A simple chipping away at the original widget/applet to show more data. I currently added album, release date and track length. It also doesn't truncate the text so will expand as far as it needs to (example below).

*TODO*  
[ ] Forgot to add track number like in the [XFCE widget](../QuodlibetXFCE_Applet/)
