# Lights Out in Python

This is just a general script to play with the idea of making a Lights Out game using just Python in a terminal. So far I can print a board, as well as make the program display "lights" based on a 2D array.

So far it just reads a pre-laid out array. I now need to code in a way to manipulate the array. As well as keep it all in a loop, implement levels. A whole heap of things. I don't anticipate this ever being *complete*, but I think it's a good exercise to learn python in general.

> I do also want to make this 2 colour compatible, so I will have to add a bit of logic for that.
