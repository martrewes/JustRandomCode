# SleepTimer

A simple python (and QT) app to sleep, hibernate, reboot or shutdown a system.

I made this to compliment a refurbished Surface Pro (hence simple UI) that I had recently purchased. All of the apps I found either didn't work, weren't optimized for touch, or ran on Electron. (Granted, the libraries for this will be quite large also, but I use Python anyway.)

Should work on Windows and Linux.

## TODO

- [ ] Make the dial and spinbox react to the time decreasing.
- [ ] Okay I need to fix the UI on windows, it's pretty awful (see screenshot)
